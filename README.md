## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Master's student in Computer Science** with a passion for building backend systems and exploring data science applications in healthcare. Originally from **Nepal 🇳🇵**, I'm currently based in Bowling Green, Ohio, where I spend my time crafting solutions that actually solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me perfecting my butter chicken recipe 🍛, dominating FIFA matches 🎮, or building productivity apps that hilariously roast users for procrastinating 😅.
